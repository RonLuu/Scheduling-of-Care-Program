# Scheduling of Care Program

A cloud-based care management system designed to support people with special needs, their families, and care service providers. This application enables structured scheduling of care activities, budget tracking, shift management, and secure access control across multiple stakeholders.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The Scheduling of Care Program addresses a critical need in care management by providing:

- **Structured Care Scheduling**: Manage recurring and one-off care activities with flexible scheduling patterns
- **Hierarchical Budget Management**: Track expenses at multiple levels (annual plans â†’ categories â†’ individual care items)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure permissions for family members, care managers, and staff
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Upload receipts, reports, and photographs linked to care activities
- **Shift Management**: Schedule and track staff assignments across different time periods
- **Budget Alerts**: Automatic notifications and email sending when particular budget thresholds are reached

**Developed by:** The **4V1C Team** (Team 81) as part of the **COMP30022 IT PROJECT** capstone subject for the **Computing and Software Systems Major**

- **npm** (v10.x or higher) - comes with Node.js
- **MongoDB** (v6.3+) - [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use MongoDB Atlas
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RonLuu/Scheduling-of-Care-Program.git
   cd Scheduling-of-Care-Program
```

2. **Install root dependencies**

```bash
   npm install
```

3. **Install server dependencies**

```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
```

```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Copy the environment template**

```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

2. **Edit `server/.env` with your configuration**

   **Required Variables:**

```bash
   # Database Connection
   MONGODB_URI_LOCAL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/care_scheduler
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://:@cluster.mongodb.net/

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-change-in-production
   TOKEN_PEPPER=your-token-pepper-change-in-production

   # File Storage (Cloudinary)
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key

### Running the Application

**Development Mode (Recommended for local development):**

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

This command starts:

- Backend server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend dev server on `http://localhost:5173` (with hot-reload)
- Backend proxies frontend requests during development

**Access the application:**

- Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
- API endpoints available at `http://localhost:3000/api/*`

**Production Mode:**

```bash
# Build the frontend
cd client
npm run build
cd ..

# Start the production server
npm start
```

## 6. Deployment

### Heroku Deployment

1. **Create Heroku app**

```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
```

2. **Add MongoDB Atlas add-on or configure external database**

```bash
   heroku addons:create mongolab
```

3. **Set environment variables**

```bash
   heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
   heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=your-atlas-connection-string
   heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=your-production-secret
   heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   # ... set all other required variables
```

4. **Deploy**

```bash
   git push heroku main
```

5. **Open application**

```bash
   heroku open
```

**Automated Deployment:**

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment:

- Pull request review apps
- Staging environment deployment
- Production deployment (manual approval required)

See `.github/workflows/` for configuration details.

## 7. Security Considerations

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Role-based access control restricts data access
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- CORS configured for specific origins in production
- File uploads restricted by type and size
- Environment variables keep secrets out of code

**For Production:**

- Use strong, randomly generated secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Enable MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
- Configure HTTPS/TLS certificates
- Set up regular database backups
- Monitor application logs for suspicious activity

## ðŸ‘¥ User Roles & Permissions

| Role                        | Permissions                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Family**                  | Full control: add clients, manage budgets, grant access, view all data       |
| **Power of Attorney (PoA)** | Identical to 'Family'                                                        |
| **Manager**                 | Manage care plans, grant staff, access, allocate staff shifts, track budgets |
| **Carer (Staff)**           | Complete tasks, record costs, upload receipts, add comments                  |

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Database connection errors:**

- Verify MongoDB is running: `mongod --version`
- Check connection string in `.env` file
- Ensure MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes your IP

**Port already in use:**

- Change `PORT` in `server/.env` to a different number
- Kill process using port 3000: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill`

**File upload errors:**

- Verify Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
- Check file size limits in `server/routes/fileUpload.js`
- Ensure `server/public/uploads/` directory exists

**Authentication issues:**

- Clear browser localStorage and cookies
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set in `.env`
- Check token expiration time
